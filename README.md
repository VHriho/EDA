# Exporatory data analysis, EDA
Stages of conducting the study:
* Checking data for obvious errors, typos, incorrect coding;
* Checking for missing data (including specifically coded data) and their potential impact on the analysis result;
* Constructing one-dimensional graphs (histograms, box plots, column charts, etc.) to identify features of the distributions of individual variables;
* Constructing two-dimensional graphs (scatter plots, in some cases line graphs, etc.) to identify dependencies between individual variables;
* Calculating and visualizing correlations between variables;
* Visualization of several variables on one graph using colors, shapes, and sizes of graph elements;
* Transformation of coordinate axes (in particular, logarithmization) for better visualization of data features.
## Tools Used: 
* R
* ggplot2
* dplyr
